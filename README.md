Personal Website Project

This project focuses on creating a personal website with three linked pages, a home page, an about page, and a portfolio page. The purpose is to display information about us as the new member of a team. 

The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, and JavaSript.

To view the project website, download the three HTML files named index.html, about.html, and portfoliohtml, one CSS file named index.css, and one JavaScript file named index.js. Open them in a server using your IDE.
